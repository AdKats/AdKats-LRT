<h1>AdKats Extension - LRT - Loadout Enforcer</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    AdKatsLRT allows for enforcement of any infantry loadout to the server owner's specs. It has automatic integration with AdKats systems, including punishments, infractions, reports, and marking.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It can enforce every infantry item (any primary, secondary, attachments for either, gadgets, knifes, and grenades) in the game.
    </li>
    <li>
        Any update made to the game's weapons are automatically imported and made available, so if DICE changes or adds weapons, they are immediately enforceable.
    </li>
    <li>
        Customizable kill messages for each denied item, with combined messages and details if more than one is spawned in the same loadout.
    </li>
    <li>
        Players notified and thanked when they fix their loadouts after being killed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Two levels of enforcement, allowing multiple levels of severity for each item.
    </li>
    <li>
        Using the reputation system, reputable players are not forced to change their loadouts, as we know they are not going to use them.
    </li>
    <li>
        Admins are whitelisted from spawn enforcment, but still fall under trigger enforcement if they are marked/punished.
    </li>
    <li>
        Through AdKats, other plugins can call loadout checks and enforcement, so it can enhance your current autoadmin.
    </li>
    <li>
        Statistics on enforcement, including percent of players enforced, percent killed for enforcement, percent who fixed their loadouts after kill, and percent who quit the server without fixing their loadouts after kill.
    </li>
</ul>

    <li>
        <b>Purchase AdKatsLRT, and aquire an extension token.</b>
        Private message ColColonCleaner on the MyRCON forums about getting the plugin. Once approved and purchased, you will be given an extension token, usable to install AdKatsLRT.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Install the plugin.</b>
        Once purchased, and your extension token aquired, simply paste the token in AdKats setting "A14. External Command Settings | AdKatsLRT Extension Token". The plugin will be automatically downloaded and installed onto your procon instance. Restart procon to see the plugin.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Enable AdKatsLRT.</b>
        AdKatsLRT will download the WARSAW library, parse its contents into usable settings, and those settings will appear. It will then wait for the first player list response from AdKats. Once that comes through, it will fully enable and loadout enforcement will be online. Enjoy your new admin tool!

<h3>Item Library</h3>
<p>
    Every infantry item in the game (about 3500 items), can be enforced here. The settings are split into 3 sections; Weapons, Gadgets, and Weapon Accessories, in that order.
</p>
<h3>Loadout Processing</h3>
<h4>Deciding Enforcement Type</h4>
<p>
    Loadouts have several reasons for being checked; A player spawns, gets reported, gets punished, gets marked, or has more than 5 infraction points. Any of these instances will call a loadout check, and the reason for checking them changes the way the enforcement works.
</p>
<p>
    When running loadout enforcement for a specific player, the reason, and action if invalid, is first decided. The following are results for specific reasons, in order of priority:
    <ul>
        <li>If a player was marked, they are set under trigger enforcement, and will be slain for invalid loadout of any kind.</li>
        <li>If a player is punished, they are set under trigger enforcement, and will be slain for invalid loadout of any kind.</li>
        <li>If a player was reported, their reputation is negative, and no admins are online, they are set under trigger enforcement and will be slain for invalid loadout of any kind. If they are slain after report, the report is automatically accepted.</li>
        <li>If a player has more than 5 infraction points, was punished in the last 2 months, their reputation is negative, and no admins are online, they are set under trigger enforcement and will be slain for invalid loadout.</li>
        <li>If a player joins, or spawns, has less than 15 reputation, and is not an admin, they are set under spawn enforcement, and will be slain for spawn denied items in their loadout.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h4>Informing and Acting</h4>
<p>
    If a player is about to be slain for loadout enforcement, regardless of enforcement type, they are shown two messages. The first is a generic message containing all denied weapons they have in their loadout "playername please remove [denied weapons] from your loadout". This messages is sent using player SAY. After that, the specific messages written by the admin for each denied item is displayed. These customizable messages are found in setting sections 5A and 5B, once denied items are selected. These messages are sent using player TELL.
</p>
<p>
    Immediately after informing the player of denied items in their loadout, they are admin killed. If they are under trigger enforcement, admins are notified of their demise, all other messages are private.
</p>
<p>
    Thank you messages are given to players who fix their loadouts. If a player is under trigger enforcement, admins are notified that they fixed their loadout.
</p>
<h3>Debug Messages</h3>
<p>
    Setting your debug level to at least 2 will display statistics in the console when stats change. The stats available are percent under loadout enforcement (should be nearly 100%), percent killed for loadout enforcement, percent who fixed their loadouts after kill, and percent who quit the server without fixing after being killed.

<tr>
    <td><b>Report Player</b></td>
    <td>report</td>
    <td>
        Reports initiate trigger level enforcement on targeted players. If the reported player has invalid items in their loadout, the report is automatically accepted, and admins notified of such.
